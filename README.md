# aiwebsite
The purpose of this website is to provide a web based application to predict ethnicity based on name and face. This builds off the research done during my research time at Cal Poly as a machine learning research assistant.


So far:

- Set up website using flask as the backend
- Simple html design that prompts user for name and to upload and image of a face
- After a succesful upload and facial detection, displays cropped face on screen
- Implemented Clarifai to detect face
- Display ethnicity in tab

Moving forward:
- Combine Clarifai with Namsor for prediction
- Create options to detect using just face or just name
- Improve and modernize UI
- Deploy website using a web service that supports Flask
